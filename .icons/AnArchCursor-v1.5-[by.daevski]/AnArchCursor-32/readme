I've tinkered with this cursor for a while, 
but I want to thank the creator "bavardage" again.

Without a template to play with, I'd have nothing.

+-- This new version (1.5) has: --+

A new Move, Crossed_Circle, and Hand.



+-- You can expect in Version 2: --+

(Maybe) Another new Hand. I don't think I like this 
one any more than the old one...

And the missing cursor pieces such as Text cursor, etc.
